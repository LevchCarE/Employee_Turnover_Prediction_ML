# Employee_Turnover_Prediction_ML

A predictive analytics project was carried out to address employee turnover at Portobello Tech. The process began with data quality validation, including the identification and handling of missing values. Factors influencing employee attrition were analyzed through correlation studies and exploratory data analysis.

Clustering techniques were applied to segment employees who had left, based on satisfaction and evaluation metrics. To manage class imbalance in the dataset, the SMOTE oversampling method was implemented. Model training was performed using k-fold cross-validation, and multiple algorithms were evaluated to determine the most accurate predictor 

Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 0.7862 ± 0.0059
Random Forest: Accuracy = 0.9864 ± 0.0007
SVM: Accuracy = 0.6993 ± 0.0046
KNN: Accuracy = 0.9504 ± 0.0024

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to select the optimal model. Based on the results, a set of targeted employee retention strategies was formulated, providing actionable insights to support the company’s HR decision-making.
